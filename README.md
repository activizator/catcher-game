Catch falling fruits and vegetables into two separate baskets—one for fruits and one for veggies! The goal is to keep a perfect balance: the number of fruits and veggies in their baskets must be equal, and the total collected must be over 10 before time runs out!

How to Play:

    Use the left and right arrow keys to move the baskets.

    The left basket catches fruits (apples, bananas, berries, etc.).

    The right basket catches vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.).

    Keep the counts equal—if one basket has more than the other, you lose points!

    Collect more than 10 items in total before the timer ends to win!
